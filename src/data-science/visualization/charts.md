## Scatter

Depict data set in partterns:
* For chocolate candies, the line has a _slightly_ `positive slope`, implies that _more expensive_ chocolate tend to be _more popular_.
* Likewise, the regression line for those without chocolate has a `negative slope`, we can say that candies without chococlate tend to be _more popular_ when they are _cheaper_

## Swarm

Depict:
Chocolate candies tend to be _more popular_ than those without chocolate.

## Bar, Histogram and KDE
* A bar chart is a `categorical` label against its `numeric`
* A histogram is a `numeric range` sliced as bins against its _`occurencies`_ 
* a KDE (Kernel Density Estimate) is a transformed `normal distribution`
